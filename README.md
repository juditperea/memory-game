# Memory Game

Welcome to my Memory Game project developed with React and TypeScript!

This memory game features 10 pairs of cards with designs of characters from Hunter X Hunter, one of the most famous and my favorite animes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: for the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: for more robust and scalable code.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Game**: The user can match cards and receive visual feedback.
- **Confetti Animations**: to celebrate when the game is completed.
- **Restart Functionality**: to start a new game at any time.
- **Turn Increment**: Each time the user matches two cards, the turn counter increases.
